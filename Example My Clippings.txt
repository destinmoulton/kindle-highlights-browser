For what is required in reasoning? To establish the truth, reject what is false, and suspend judgement in doubtful cases. [6] Is it enough, then, to learn that alone?

Why should one let oneself be dazzled by those who have great possessions and hold powerful positions, especially if they’re both strong and bad-tempered? [21] For what can they do to us? The things that they have the power to do are of no concern to us, and when it comes to the things that matter to us, they have no power over those.

Don’t you know how small a part you are by comparison to the whole? With regard to your body, I mean; for when it comes to your reason, you’re not inferior to the gods nor do you fall short of them, because the greatness of reason is measured not by height or length, but by the quality of its judgements.

Thinking? At last I have discovered it - thought; this alone is inseparable from me. I am, I exist-that is certain. But for how long? For as long as I am thinking. For it could be, that were I totally to cease from thinking, I should totally cease to exist.... I am, then, in the strict sense only a thing that thinks.

I can think that I am skiing when I am not, for I may be dreaming, or deluded by the Demon. However, I cannot think that I am thinking when I am not. For in this case (and only this case) the mere fact that I think that I am thinking guarantees that I am thinking. It is itself an example of thinking.
